"""Asset for arranging primitives by geometry."""

== Overview ==
    Asset for arranging primitives or creating points by geometry. The geometry for the collision can be as the geometry submitted to the first input,
so is the geometry directly from the viewport (if you do not submit anything to the first input). Working with the asset is done by means of the scene viewport (Scene View))
NOTE:
    For more convenient work on primitives, it is desirable to have the attribute name or ms_name (string)



@parameters

Mode:
    #id: mode
    Switches the modes of setting instances by clicking the left mouse button.

Display Handle:
    #id: display_handle
    Includes\Disables the handle for local transformation.

NOTE:
    Changes the parameters concerning local instance transformations.

Use instance for Collision:
    #id: instcol
    Includes the use of already supplied primitives for further collision.

NOTE: It
    only works with geometry submitted to the first input.

Random Rotate:
    #id: random_rotate
    When setting up a new primitive, generate a random rotation along the Y axis.

Auto Selection:
    #id: auto_select
    Allows you to quickly select already supplied primitives for further transformation or replacement.

Clean Attributes:
    #id: cleaninfo
    Deletes attributes created by this node (transform, info).

Sensetivity Multiply:
    #id: sensetivity Sensitivity
    multiplier of hotkeys for transformations.

Bias Normal to Y:
    #id: biasnorm
    When setting primitives, the basic orientation is taken from the normal of the collision object. This parameter
    responsible for changing the vector between the normal and the Y axis.

Update Positions:
    #id: updp
    Updates instance positions if the collider position has been changed at the Sop level. (without changing the numbering of primitives).

Auto obj transform:
    #id: objautotr
    Updates instance positions if the collider position has been changed at the Obj level.

Number of Points:
    #id: points
    The number of primitives installed.

Position:
    #id: position_
    The base position of the intersection with the collision.

Rotate:
    #id: rotate_
    Basic orientation when intersecting with a collision.

Local Transform:
    #id: loctransform_
    Local transformation, changed by a handle or hotkeys.

Local Rotate:
    #id: locrotate_
    The local orientation is changed by the handle or hotkeys.

Local Scale:
    #id: scale
    Scale, changeable by handle or hotkeys.

Instance:
    #id: scale_
    The name of the primitive for the point (the list of names is taken from the attribute name or ms_name).

ID:
    #id: id
    is the instance number.


@HotKeys

((LMB)) on geometry in the viewport. Creates a new instance.

((MMB)) on geometry in the viewport. Moves the current instance.

((mouse_wheel)) Rotates the current instance around the local Y axis.

((Shift + mouse_wheel)) Shifts the current instance along the local Y axis.

((Ctrl + mouse_wheel)) Changes the scale of the current instance.

+ - Changes the geometry of the current instance.
((M)) Switches instance setting modes
((Shift + D)) Includes/Disables random selection of instance geometry from the list. If disabled, then in the future the geometry of the new instances will be inherited from the current one.
((Shift + Z)) Includes/Disables inheritance of local transformations for new instances.
@State_Options
    Called by right-clicking in the viewport. ((RMB))

Instances:
    Calls a list for random sampling. From these names, the instance of the primitive is selected during the initial statement.

Replace Current:
    Replaces the current instance with an instance from the list.

Reset Local Transform:
    Resets local transformations for the current instance.

Remove Current:
    Disables the current instance.
